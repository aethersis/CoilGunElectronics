# CoilGunElectronics
A collection of parts needed to build multistage coil guns. I try to design everything so that it can take up to 600V. Coating solder joints with special insulating varnish is still recommended. The coil gun stages are designed for 400V 470uF or 1000uF capacitors and the traces should be additionally plated with thick layer of solder or a wire should be soldered alongside those traces.
